              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">What is an RTF File?</h2>
              <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">
                An RTF file is a document saved in the Rich Text Format, a file format developed by Microsoft in 1987
                for cross-platform document interchange. RTF files support text formatting, such as font styles, sizes,
                colors, and document formatting like margins, tables, and images.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-600">
                Unlike plain text files, RTF documents preserve formatting across different word processors and
                operating systems, making them ideal for sharing formatted documents between users with different
                software.

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Full Meaning of RTF</h2>
              <p className="text-gray-600">
                RTF stands for <strong>Rich Text Format</strong>. It was created as a universal format that could be
                read by most word processors, regardless of the operating system or software being used. The "Rich" in
                Rich Text Format refers to the ability to include formatting information beyond plain text.

              <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 text-gray-600">
                <li>
                  <strong>Cross-Platform Compatibility:</strong> Use RTF when you need to share documents with people
                  using different operating systems or word processors.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>File Size:</strong> RTF files are typically larger than plain text files but smaller than DOCX
                  files with similar content.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Formatting Preservation:</strong> RTF preserves basic formatting like bold, italic, underline,
                  font sizes, and colors across different applications.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Image Support:</strong> While RTF supports images, complex image formatting may not transfer
                  perfectly between all applications.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Legacy Support:</strong> RTF is supported by older word processors that might not handle newer
                  formats like DOCX.
                </li>

                    What's the difference between RTF and DOCX?
                  </h3>
                  <p className="text-gray-600">
                    RTF is an older, more universally compatible format that preserves basic formatting. DOCX is
                    Microsoft's newer proprietary format that supports more advanced features but may not be compatible
                    with all word processors.

                  <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-2">
                    Can I convert an RTF file to other formats?
                  </h3>
                  <p className="text-gray-600">
                    Yes, most word processors can open RTF files and save them in other formats like DOCX, PDF, or plain
                    text. Simply open the RTF file and use the "Save As" function to select your desired format.
                  </p>

                <div>
                  <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-2">Are RTF files secure?</h3>
                  <p className="text-gray-600">
                    RTF files can contain macros and other potentially harmful elements, just like DOCX files. Always be
                    cautious when opening RTF files from unknown sources.
                  </p>
                </div>

                <div>
                  <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-2">
                    Why would I use RTF instead of plain text?
                  </h3>
                  <p className="text-gray-600">
                    RTF preserves formatting like bold, italic, font sizes, and colors, which plain text files cannot.
                    If you need any formatting in your document, RTF is a better choice than plain text.
                  </p>

                <div>
                  <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-2">Is RTF still relevant today?</h3>
                  <p className="text-gray-600">
                    Yes, RTF remains relevant for cross-platform compatibility and situations where you need a format
                    that's widely supported by both new and legacy software. It's a good middle ground between plain
                    text and more complex formats.
