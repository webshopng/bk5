                <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-6">What is a Java File?</h2>
                <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                  A Java file (.java) contains source code written in the Java programming language. These files are
                  compiled into bytecode (.class files) that can run on any device with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM),
                  making Java a "write once, run anywhere" language. Java files typically contain class definitions,
                  methods, and other programming constructs that follow object-oriented programming principles.

                <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-6">Full Meaning of Java</h2>
                <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                  Java doesn't have an acronym meaning - it was named after Java coffee, which is why its logo is a
                  coffee cup. It was developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems (now owned by Oracle Corporation)
                  and released in 1995. The name was chosen during a coffee break discussion among the language's
                  creators, reflecting their love for coffee.

                      What's the difference between Java and JavaScript?
                    </h3>
                    <p className="text-gray-700">
                      Despite the similar names, Java and JavaScript are completely different languages. Java is a
                      compiled, strongly-typed language used for a wide range of applications, while JavaScript is
                      primarily an interpreted language used for web development. The name similarity was a marketing
                      decision, not a technical one.

                    <p className="text-gray-700">
                      Yes, Java remains one of the most popular programming languages in the world. It's widely used in
                      enterprise applications, Android development, big data processing, and many other domains. Its
                      "write once, run anywhere" capability and robust ecosystem ensure its continued relevance.

                      Do I need to install anything to run Java files?
                    </h3>
                    <p className="text-gray-700">
                      Yes, to compile and run Java files, you need to install the Java Development Kit (JDK). To only
                      run compiled Java applications, you need the Java Runtime Environment (JRE). Both are available
                      from Oracle or as open-source alternatives like OpenJDK.

                    <p className="text-gray-700">
                      To compile a Java file, use the javac command: <code>javac YourFile.java</code>. This creates a
                      .class file containing bytecode. To run the compiled program, use the java command:{" "}
                      <code>java YourClassName</code> (without the .class extension).

                    <p className="text-gray-700">
                      Java follows a six-month release cycle. As of early 2023, Java 20 is the latest version. However,
                      Long-Term Support (LTS) versions like Java 8, 11, and 17 are more commonly used in production
                      environments due to their extended support periods.
